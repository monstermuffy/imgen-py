# imgen-py

call "py imgen.py" to run

all assets should be stored in subfolders: 

assets/fruitname/fruitname_property/fruitname_propertyname#100.png

fruitname just means one group of assets which will all fit together, ie. all banana assets
we then have each property (eyes, mouths, legs etc.) in the "fruitname_property" folder
in each fruitname_property folder we have each png asset, all assets must end in #100.png where 100 is the relative rarity
